PARENT DIRECTORY:ioctl_buffer.
This folder contains 3 files:
	1)a kernel module file.
	2)a header file which defines the ioctl calls.
	3)a user space application.
	
a)A Makefile is included in the parent directory.
b)Open the parent directory in terminal.
c)Type "make" command in terminal.It will create the required object files in all the subdirectories.Same is true for "make clean" command.

Question:1)A module that uses the ioctl to pass data buffer from user-space to kernel space and vice versa.

a)Open the folder "ioctl_buffer" in terminal.
b)type :sudo insmod ioctl_buffer.ko .Default major number is 100.
c)sudo mknod /dev/ioctl_buffer c 100 0.
d)sudo chmod 666 /dev/ioctl_buffer.
e)echo "some text" > /dev/ioctl_buffer.(the device file is initially empty.To read something  for the first time using ioctl we are echoing a sample text.)
d)gcc -o output ioctl_user.c
e)./output
f)sudo rmmod ioctl_buffer.
e)make clean.
